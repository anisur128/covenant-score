# covenant-score
Governance-adjustable scoring architecture for contribution-weighted reputation in decentralized ecosystems.

**Primary Principle:** Capital Serves Public Goods

Covenant Score is a non-transferable, governance-adjustable reputation system designed to elevate high-quality artifact contributions and strengthen decentralized stewardship.

Rather than amplifying financial capital or surface-level participation, Covenant Score aligns influence with meaningful contribution to shared public goods.

# Abstract

Covenant Score introduces a structured evaluation framework that measures artifact quality, peer validation, governance engagement, and sustained participation.

While participation within The Covenant requires verified personhood, contribution depth varies. Covenant Score differentiates signal from noise by applying transparent scoring parameters that reward intellectual rigor, principle alignment, and long-term stewardship.

The system separates reputation from financial ownership and ensures influence reflects public-good contribution rather than capital accumulation. Governance parameters remain adjustable to preserve decentralized stewardship and ecosystem adaptability.

By operationalizing contribution-weighted influence, Covenant Score reinforces Capital Serves Public Goods as measurable governance infrastructure.

# Problem Statement

Binary participation models (submit / not submit) fail to distinguish:

- High-rigor research from low-effort artifacts  
- Long-term contributors from one-time participants  
- Governance-aligned thinking from superficial engagement  

Without quality differentiation, ecosystems risk signal dilution, cultural drift, and incentive distortion.

Covenant Score introduces structured evaluation to preserve intellectual and governance integrity.

# System Architecture

Covenant Score operates across three layers:

## 1. Identity Layer
- Built on proof-of-personhood infrastructure  
- Ensures unique human participation  
- No token-weighted influence  

## 2. Contribution Layer
Artifacts are evaluated across:

- Originality & Rigor  
- Alignment with Core Principles  
- Practical Applicability  
- Peer Review Quality  
- Governance Participation  
- Stewardship Duration  

## 3. Governance Utility Layer
Score may influence:

- Curator selection  
- Proposal prioritization  
- Stewardship role eligibility  
- Review weighting  

Score does NOT:
- Represent financial value  
- Transfer between users  
- Function as a tradable asset

# Scoring Model (Conceptual)

Base Score =  
(Artifact Impact × 0.35) +  
(Peer Validation × 0.25) +  
(Governance Engagement × 0.20) +  
(Stewardship Duration × 0.20)

Where:

Artifact Impact = evaluation of rigor, originality, and alignment  
Peer Validation = weighted by reviewer credibility  
Governance Engagement = proposal and discourse participation  
Stewardship Duration = long-term participation multiplier  

Weights are governance-adjustable.

# Decay Mechanism

To prevent early dominance and encourage sustained engagement:

Adjusted Score = Base Score × e^(-λt)

λ = decay constant  
t = months inactive  

This promotes long-term stewardship over short-term bursts.

# Design Principles

- Non-transferable reputation  
- Transparent scoring logic  
- Governance-adjustable parameters  
- Resistant to activity farming  
- Long-term alignment incentives  

---

# Expected Ecosystem Impact

Covenant Score strengthens:

- Intellectual culture  
- Governance credibility  
- Public goods alignment  
- Long-term ecosystem resilience  

It transforms artifact submission from a binary act into a structured quality continuum.
